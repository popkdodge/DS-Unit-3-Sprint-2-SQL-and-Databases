# 3- How many passengers survived/died within each class?
# 4- What was the average age of survivors vs nonsurvivors?
# 5- What was the average age of each passenger class?
# 6- What was the average fare by passenger class? By survival?
# 7- How many siblings/spouses aboard on average, by passenger class?
#  By survival?
# 8- How many parents/children aboard on average, by passenger class?
#  By survival?
# - Do any passengers have the same name?
# - (Bonus! Hard, may require pulling and processing with Python)
#  How many married?
#   couples were aboard the Titanic? Assume that two people (one `Mr.` and one
#   `Mrs.`) with the same last name
# and with at least 1 sibling/spouse aboard are
#   a married couple.
